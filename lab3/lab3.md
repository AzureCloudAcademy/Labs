# Integrating Active Directory


In this lab, we will focus on how to integrate Azure Active Directory for managing user and group access. We will discuss two approaches: the classic manual integration method and the template-based method. For the template method, you will need to subscribe to the "AD Entra Integration" template using a Cloudairy account.ive Directory

## Important notes

- What is A tenant ? :  represents your organization and helps you to manage a specific instance of Microsoft cloud services for your internal and external users.

- Microsoft Entra ID has user and guest accounts. Each account has a level of access specific to the scope of work expected to be done.

- Groups combine together related users or devices. There are two types of groups including Security and Microsoft 365.

- Group membership can be statically or dynamically assigned.
## 1. Classic Integration Method

The classic approach involves manual configuration of Active Directory integration. Begin by installing the necessary connectors or agents on your server. Manually configure synchronization rules, user and group mappings, and set up authentication protocols. This method offers more granular control but requires a deeper understanding of Active Directory and integration processes.

## 2. Using Entra ID Template

Leverage the Entra ID integration template for a streamlined setup. This method provides a guided experience, automating much of the configuration. Start by selecting the Entra ID template in your integration portal, then follow the prompts to connect your Active Directory domain. The template handles synchronization settings, user provisioning, and permissions mapping, reducing manual steps and potential errors.
