1. Epic (Big Goal) - Big project goal / Requirement / complete in multiple sprint
2. Feature (Capability) - part of that big dream
3. Story (User Story / Small Need) - small piece of work
4. Task (Work Item for Developer/Team) - The step-by-step actions the team needs to do to complete the story.

----------

Epic = Big project goal
Feature = A useful part of the goal
Story = Userâ€™s small need
Task = Actual work to make it happen

 ðŸ”¹ 1. Story Point vs Hours

Story Points â‰  Hours (Direct conversion nahi hota).
Story Points measure relative effort (complexity, work, risk).

ðŸ‘‰ Example (Fibonacci scale):

1 Point â†’ 2â€“3 hours ka kaam (very small)
2 Points â†’ 4â€“6 hours (small task)
3 Points â†’ 1 day work (medium)
5 Points â†’ 2â€“3 days work (bigger story)
8 Points â†’ ~1 week work (complex story)
13 Points â†’ More than a week (very complex, maybe break into smaller stories)
