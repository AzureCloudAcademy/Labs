Azure ADO Board

Azure DevOps is a cloud-based, end-to-end platform for DevOps practices â€” enabling teams to:
Plan work (Azure Boards)
Collaborate on code (Azure Repos)
Build, test, and deploy consistently (Azure Pipelines)
Ensure code quality (Azure Test Plans)
Share and manage artifacts (Azure Artifacts)

------------

Flow: Backlog â†’ Sprint Planning â†’ Execution â†’ Review â†’ Retrospective â†’ Repeatâ€‹
âœ” Faster delivery of valueâ€‹
âœ” Adapts to changeâ€‹
âœ” Better collaboration & transparencyâ€‹
âœ” Continuous improvement & learningâ€‹
âœ” Higher customer satisfaction


Agile = Iterative & incremental way of delivering valueâ€‹
Sprints (1â€“4 weeks) â†’ Plan, Build, Test, Deliver, Improveâ€‹
Roles: Product Owner (WHAT), Scrum Master (PROCESS), Team (HOW)â€‹
Events: Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, Retrospectiveâ€‹
Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment


------------------

where a team plans, builds, tests, reviews, and improves continuously.
1
Product Owner = What & Why
Development Team = How & Delivery
Scrum Master = Process Coach

Product Owner â†’ Owns the Product Backlog (What needs to be built, priorities).
Scrum Master â†’ Owns the Process (Ensures Agile practices, removes blockers).
Development Team â†’ Owns the Sprint Backlog & Delivery (How to build it, tasks, execution).



===============================
1. Epic (Big Goal) - Big project goal / Requirement / complete in multiple sprint
2. Feature (Capability) - part of that big dream
3. Story (User Story / Small Need) - small piece of work
4. Task (Work Item for Developer/Team) - The step-by-step actions the team needs to do to complete the story.

----------

Epic = Big project goal
Feature = A useful part of the goal
Story = Userâ€™s small need
Task = Actual work to make it happen

Epic â†’ Feature â†’ Story â†’ Task

(small/medium/large)
-----------------------
 ðŸ”¹ 1. Story Point vs Hours

Story Points â‰  Hours (Direct conversion nahi hota).
Story Points measure relative effort (complexity, work, risk).

ðŸ‘‰ Example (Fibonacci scale):

1 Point â†’ 2â€“3 hours (very small)
2 Points â†’ 4â€“6 hours (small task)
3 Points â†’ 1 day work (medium)
5 Points â†’ 2â€“3 days work (bigger story)
8 Points â†’ ~1 week work (complex story)
13 Points â†’ More than a week (very complex, maybe break into smaller stories)


â–  Agile Sprint Cycle
1. Sprint Planning â†’ Select stories & define sprint goal
2. Daily Scrum â†’ 15-min team sync
3. Development & Testing â†’ Work on stories & tasks
4. Sprint Review â†’ Demo to stakeholders
5. Sprint Retrospective â†’ Reflect & improv
